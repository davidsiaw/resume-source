### Hello there!

I am a Software Engineer of more than 10 years living in Japan. I strive towards the day when I can make great contributions to humanity by using my skills.

I believe in building things with both my mind and my heart. While it also has to be efficient, my software has always been made for people to use, and to make life easier in as many ways as my limited lifespan will allow.

I pay tremendous attention to detail, and I work on jobs in a holistic manner and attempt to understand as much as I can in order to be able to build the best software for the task.

Such a piece of software is likely to be crafted piecemeal, but to arrive at perfection, one must make the necessary steps to perfection.

Failure is something I design for, and is something I expect. I see value in both testing and proving my program is correct, wherever economical, and I accept that I am not omniscient to the failure cases, but I have the persistence to stand up and keep the show running.

I believe freedom and recreation is something all humans need to to take part in, to remember what it is we live for. We must all have fun and work in equal parts.

If you have a job that will both challenge me and give me these freedoms, please let me know and I would be happy to discuss your venture with you!
