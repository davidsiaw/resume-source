I enjoy programming primarily in my spare time. When I have ideas I will begin work on them and attempt to achieve a minimum viable product. Documentation has always been my weak points so I created [weaver](http://davidsiaw.github.io/weaver-docs/) to facilitate that.

I open source all of my hobby projects, mostly because I believe that people should benefit from my work even when I am not paid for it, which is how I believe the world should eventually work. But mostly its because I know no-one has the time or energy to look at them even if I shoved it in their face.

I believe software engineering is a skill all humans should eventually have. While that may decrease my job prospects, it would definitely make the world a much better place to live in.

Anime and manga are things I enjoy greatly. If you have similar interests I would love to hang out. I also love nesoberi plushes.

Games are a big passion of mine too. I would love to create games. If you are a game company, you already have a lot of my attention.

Playing crane games is a small gambling habit of mine, but I think it reminds me that it is sometimes possible to find answers in places where things seem impossible.

I enjoy playing the guitar and taking photos of sceneries around Japan.

I run a small doujin (amateur fanart) circle here [at Fliptable](https://fliptable.astrobunny.net) under the pen name astrobunny. Together we have released 8 books so far but my artistic ability is far from satisfactory. I intend to work hard at this to improve myself.
